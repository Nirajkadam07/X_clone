# X_clone

I have made this X (twitter) clone in vanilla JS by following Scrimba tutorial, I am trying to add new feature in it as a stretch goal and having trouble doing that, but I am going to figure it out and update the file later here

Following are the concepts that I learnt:
textarea, .forEach(), data attributes, filter method, conditionally rendering styles, CDN's for generating uuid and adding icons
